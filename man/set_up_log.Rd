\usage{
set_up_log(
  my_logfile = "logfile.txt",
  user_seed = NULL,
  console_echo = FALSE,
  overwrite_log = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{my_logfile}{Character string for log file name.
Default is \emph{logfile.txt}.}

\item{user_seed}{optional integer seed provided by user and passed to \code{initiate_seed()}
Default uses \code{initiate_seed()} to set and store a new seed each time.}

\item{console_echo}{Calls function \code{echo_log_console()}. Default
setting is \code{FALSE} so log messages are not toggled to console.}

\item{overwrite_log}{Logical variable that specifies whether
the log file should be overwritten (\code{TRUE}) or preserved
 with a unique file name that is pre-pended with a time stamp (\code{FALSE}). The default is \code{TRUE}, so there is a
 single log file whose contents are refreshed very time the
 script is run. Change this to \code{FALSE} only if you are
 using the log messages to help debug a program and you want
 to preserve a distinctly named log file every time the script is
 executed. In this case, the file name has a 6 digit prefix
 pre-pended to it in the form \emph{"HHMMSS-my_logfile"}.
 The six digits represents the hours (HH), minutes (MM),
 and seconds (SS) taken from the time stamp,
 followed by a hyphen and the log file
 name (either user-supplied, or the default \emph{"logfile.txt"}}
}
\value{
Creates log file.
