\title{Remove data objects from the global environment}
\usage{
clear_data(keep = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{keep}{the names of objects to keep, either as a character string or
vector of character strings. If NULL, all data objects will be removed.}
}
\value{
Global objects which are not functions are removed from the
  environment.
}
\description{
\code{clear_data()} wraps around \code{rm()} to remove data
  objects from the global environment, but does not remove sourced functions.
  It is a convenient function to put at the end of modular scripts to shed
  any errant objects.
}
\details{
It is important to note that this function does not provide a clean
  slate restart of R. Full resets should be performed liberally, either by
  closing and restarting R or using "CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + F10". Clearing
  objects from the environment does not achieve this. Rather,
  \code{clear_data()} is meant to be used at the end of modular scripts.
  Pertinent objects can either be saved to .rds or by using the \code{keep}
  argument, while all other data objects will be removed.
}
\examples{
# Remove all data objects
x <- 3
y <- "apple"
clear_data()

# Keep one data object
x <- 3
y <- "apple"
z <- TRUE
clear_data('x')

# Keep multiple data objects
x <- 3
y <- "apple"
z <- TRUE
clear_data(c('x', 'y'))
}
